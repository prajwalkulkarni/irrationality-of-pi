## Irrationality of Ï€

- Pi is an irrational number, meaning, no two whole numbers, expressed as a/b can equal to the value of Pi
- It is also the ratio of circumference to the diameter of a circle.
- "I prefer pi" is a palidrome.
- The Feynman point is a mathematical coincidence. It states that from position 762, there are six consecutive 9s in the decimal expansion of pi.
- Why is Pi popular amongst the other irrational numbers? Maybe because it is edible? :v
